    "As organizations grow, business analysts increasingly face the challenge of navigating large volumes of reports, research papers, and strategic documents. Extracting the right insights from lengthy materials can be time-consuming and overwhelming, especially when these insights directly influence key business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider joining a venture capital firm like Andreessen Horowitz and being assigned a dense report such as Harvard Business Review’s **“How Apple is Organized for Innovation.”** Manually reviewing such documents requires significant effort, slowing down the analysis process and increasing the chances of missing important details.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this information overload, businesses can leverage **Semantic Search** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** models. These systems allow analysts to ask natural-language questions like, *“How does Apple structure its teams for innovation?”* and instantly retrieve relevant, accurate insights from the source document.\n",
